CTF = Compile Time Feature...

1.	For cycle accurate 6809, changed PH2 to cpu_cycle_ena. (Improve timing of control register writes)
2.	Changed PIA(s) addressing to alow complete mirror through FF00-FF3F 


To Do...
1.	Fix assign	SDC_EN_CS
2.	Add new color dithering...



CTF = Compile Time Feature...

1.	Interrupt system restored to previous code - improved compadibility.
2.	Changed to cycle accurate 6809 (Greg Miller) at speeds up to 9.56Mhz. [CTF]
3.	Recoded sdc and fdc to only have one instance of the wd1773.
4.	Re-added software disable in sdc [Ext 'g'].
5.	Recoded Cartridge bank switching to only exist when MiSTer slot 3 is selected. [removed soft multipak select]
6.	Moved CoCo Hardware RS-232 from always existing to only existing in multipak slot 1.
7.	Changed ADRS (SDS sig) decoding to = FF40-FF5f per hardware.
8.	Fixed coding problem in os9 driver llcocosdc to work with MPI properly. [CTF]
9.	Set default disk size to constant $555555 to fix os9 redirect problem. [CTF]
10	Disabled GART [GIMEX hardware DMA] to prevent OS9 from detecting GIMEX. [CTF]
11	Corrected missing begin statement in master timing loop.
12.	Fixed Donkey King DAPD issue in Tom Mix program [DPAD now moved joysticks to limits under dpad
13. Fixed incorrect addressing of FE00-FEFF for CARTs which gets PITFALL and RAMPAGE working
14.	Updated MiSTer framework
