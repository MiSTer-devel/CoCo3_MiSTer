1.	For cycle accurate 6809, changed PH2 to cpu_cycle_ena. (Improve timing of control register writes)
2.	Changed PIA(s) addressing to allow complete mirror through FF00-FF3F 
3.	Corrected usage of SG6 enable (SW5 in orig code) which allows the usage of SG6.  Formerly it was used to 
    enable artifacts.  That is no longer true.  For most compatibility it has be relabeled 'CoCo3 LC',
	and it default setting is Yes which is fully compatible with the CoCo3. [setting no allows SG6 mode].
	For some OS9 software this must be set to 'Yes' which is the default.
4.	Added 'Artifact Type' menu in 'Video Settings' menu.  Settings are 'MESS', 'Simple', and 'NONE'.  'MESS'
	is the default and has improved fidelity over 'Simple' which was previously implemented in connection 
	with SW5 [see above].  Again, the default should be used.  The artifact emulation can be turned off
	by setting the option to 'NONE'.  The 'Artifact Color Set' choice is only valid for 'MESS' and 'Simple'
	artifact settings.



To Do...
1.	Fix Color File II
2.	Fic Castle of Tharoggad 



CTF = Compile Time Feature...

1.	Interrupt system restored to previous code - improved compadibility.
2.	Changed to cycle accurate 6809 (Greg Miller) at speeds up to 9.56Mhz. [CTF]
3.	Recoded sdc and fdc to only have one instance of the wd1773.
4.	Re-added software disable in sdc [Ext 'g'].
5.	Recoded Cartridge bank switching to only exist when MiSTer slot 3 is selected. [removed soft multipak select]
6.	Moved CoCo Hardware RS-232 from always existing to only existing in multipak slot 1.
7.	Changed ADRS (SDS sig) decoding to = FF40-FF5f per hardware.
8.	Fixed coding problem in os9 driver llcocosdc to work with MPI properly. [CTF]
9.	Set default disk size to constant $555555 to fix os9 redirect problem. [CTF]
10	Disabled GART [GIMEX hardware DMA] to prevent OS9 from detecting GIMEX. [CTF]
11	Corrected missing begin statement in master timing loop.
12.	Fixed Donkey King DAPD issue in Tom Mix program [DPAD now moved joysticks to limits under dpad
13. Fixed incorrect addressing of FE00-FEFF for CARTs which gets PITFALL and RAMPAGE working
14.	Updated MiSTer framework
